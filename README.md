# Airline_passenger_satisfaction_query

Using SQL to query airline data

For this project, I participated in the maven airline satisfaction challenge to understand their overall experience. 

The data scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, 
and type of travel, as well as ther evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

Attached is a link to the sample data and the recommended analysis carried out: https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground

NB: I used Google Bigquery, so you should reference the FROM command properly.
